### Coding Challenge #1

This challenge is to build your own version of the Unix command line tool wc! The wc command displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output. The program should accept a file name as input and then print three numbers showing the count of lines, words, and bytes in the file.
