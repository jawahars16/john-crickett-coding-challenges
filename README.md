This repo contains series of solutions for code challenges published by John Crickett in Linkedin [newsletter](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/coding-challenges-7040206098607308801/).

### Coding Challenge #1

This challenge is to build your own version of the Unix command line tool wc! The wc command displays the number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file, or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output. The program should accept a file name as input and then print three numbers showing the count of lines, words, and bytes in the file.

### Codeing Challenge #2

This challenge is to build your own JSON parser.

Building a JSON parser is an easy way to learn about parsing techniques which are useful for everything from parsing simple data formats through to building a fully featured compiler for a programming language.

Parsing is often broken up into two stages: lexical analysis and syntactic analysis. Lexical analysis is the process of dividing a sequence of characters into meaningful chunks, called tokens. Syntactic analysis (which is also sometimes referred to as parsing) is the process of analysing the list of tokens to match it to a formal grammar.
